tint
====

A open source project for firefox that recolors images for color deficient people

The goal of this project is to create a add-on for firefox that will allow color deficient people the ability to better understand images. Tint will change the color mapping of the image so that they can then see what is going on in the image.

Currently I am just building javascript to recolor the image then I will work on integrating tint into firefox.
